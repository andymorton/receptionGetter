What is this script?
----------------------------------------

This script was developed to allow a website to downloaded into a folder, repeatedly on the crontab

Why?  

We use a noticeboard system, that is hosted, but continually refreshing is a huge bandwidth hog, and so to limit that, it was put that we should download the website on the crontab and then run the website locally.

This way, it should never be unavailable, and bandwidth can be monitored.

Building
----------------------------------------
This doesn't need built - just ensure that you have wget on your system


Running
----------------------------------------

Alter the URL and log file (if required) in the script, and run using

$ get_reception.sh



Other Info
----------------------------------------

Don't put your website into a general directory.
Make a specific one and ensure that permissions are set properly!
